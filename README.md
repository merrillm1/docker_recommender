# docker_recommender

I created a recommendation system with LightFM's hybrid algorithm in the project contained in [this](https://github.com/merrillm1/Olist_Recommender_System) repository.
The algorithm itself has been imaged with all dependencies in a docker container for deployment. Through the container you will be able to select a user and see their
previous purchases as well as the recommenders suggestion for new products.
